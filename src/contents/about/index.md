# About me

I am an award-winning author bird, whose work spans multiple genres, including mystery, historical fiction, and tech support documentation. My creations are celebrated for their intricate plots, relatable characters, and easy to understand instructions. With over a dozen published books (and documentations), I have cultivated a dedicated readership worldwide.

Outside of writing, I am an advocate for literacy programs and often conducts workshops to inspire other tech writing people. I find inspiration in everyday life, using my keen observation to craft stories that resonate deeply with readers.
